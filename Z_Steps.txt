1]  Create a Next JS app with shadcn
2] Setup global settings, tailwind config , layout.tsx for app folder that contains all the fonts,styles,colours


                                     /* Route Groups */
   As we know File System based routing is done in Next.JS
   And we gonna use diff layouts for diff kinda pages hence we need route groups
   In the app directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths.
   However, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.
   

3] create a (root) folder to create a route group in app dir
   Within that make page.tsx & and 
   layout.tsx   --> This layout will contain the Sidebar and remaining children components and also nothing related to 

4] Similarly (auth) folder that will have its own layout.tsx  --> This wont have sidebar as we dont need it for signup/login

*** Now we have got a main layout.tsx in app dir which has all the texts,fonts,colours for everything
    We got Seperate layouts for main pages & Signup pages that have or dont have specific components

5]  Create sign-up & sign-in folders within auth and within them create their own page.tsx

*** So how our url works now is http://localhost:3000/sign-in or http://localhost:3000/sign-up 
    & NOT http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-in is because of the route group we used while creating (auth) folder
    hence its not included in path url
